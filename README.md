# sudoku-solver

Sudoku solver written in python. There are two instances of the solver, one being obsolete, the other more efficient.
The efficient one uses backtracking, a recursive algorithm that checks for every number what works in the Sudoku constraint.

The repository also contains an incomplete web version.
